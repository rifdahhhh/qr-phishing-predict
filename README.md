## üìå Overview

**QR-Phishing-Predict** is an intelligent threat detection system that identifies phishing attacks embedded in QR codes, commonly referred to as **quishing**. Instead of decoding the embedded URL, this model focuses on analyzing the **visual patterns and pixel structure** of the QR image to predict whether it is **safe** or **malicious**.

The model was trained using the dataset from Kaggle:  
üìÇ [Benign and Malicious QR Codes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samahsadiq/benign-and-malicious-qr-codes)

---

## üß† Key Features

- Predicts phishing attacks based on QR code image structure without decoding the URL
- Built with deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow + Keras)
- Streamlit-based web application for intuitive interaction
- Automated prediction with clear output indicators
- Modular design for easy retraining and model replacement

## üöÄ Getting Started

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or newer
* pip or pipenv

### üîß Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rifdahhhh/qr-phishing-predict.git
cd qr-phishing-predict
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Web App

```bash
streamlit run dashboard/main.py
```

Then open your browser at: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

## üìä How It Works

1. Users upload a QR code image through the Streamlit interface.
2. The image is processed to extract pixel-level features.
3. The model makes a prediction using visual-based classification.
4. The result is displayed with a label:

   * ‚úÖ **Safe**
   * ‚ö†Ô∏è **Phishing Suspected**

> Note: This model does **not** decode the QR content or analyze URLs. It strictly performs prediction based on image features.

## üìà Model Performance

The model was trained and evaluated using standard metrics. The results are as follows:

* **Training Accuracy**: 95.67%
* **Training Loss**: 0.0750
* **Validation Accuracy**: 96.04%
* **Validation Loss**: 0.0814

These results indicate the model is highly capable of distinguishing malicious from benign QR codes based solely on image structure.
